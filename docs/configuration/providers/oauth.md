Authentication Providers in **NextAuth.js** are OAuth definitions which allow your users to sign in with their favorite preexisting logins. You can use any of our many predefined providers, or write your own custom OAuth configuration.

- [Using a built-in OAuth Provider](#oauth-providers) (e.g Github, Twitter, Google, etc...)
- [Using a custom OAuth Provider](#using-a-custom-provider)

:::note
NextAuth.js is designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports **OAuth 1.0**, **1.0A**, **2.0** and **OpenID Connect** and has built-in support for most popular sign-in services.
:::

Without going into too much detail, the OAuth flow generally has 6 parts:

1. The application requests authorization to access service resources from the user
2. If the user authorized the request, the application receives an authorization grant
3. The application requests an access token from the authorization server (API) by presenting authentication of its own identity, and the authorization grant
4. If the application identity is authenticated and the authorization grant is valid, the authorization server (API) issues an access token to the application. Authorization is complete.
5. The application requests the resource from the resource server (API) and presents the access token for authentication
6. If the access token is valid, the resource server (API) serves the resource to the application

## How to

1. Register your application at the developer portal of your provider. There are usually links to the portals included in the aforementioned documentation pages for each supported provider with details on how to register your application.

2. The redirect URI (sometimes called Callback URL) should follow this format:

```
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

`[provider]` refers to the `id` of your provider (see [options](#options)). For example, Twitter on `localhost` this would be:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitter
```

Using Google in our example application would look like this:

```
https://next-auth-example.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add the client ID and client secret. For Twitter this would be:

```
TWITTER_ID=YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID
TWITTER_SECRET=YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Now you can add the provider settings to the NextAuth options object. You can add as many OAuth providers as you like, as you can see `providers` is an array.

```js title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import TwitterProvider from "next-auth/providers/"
...
providers: [
  TwitterProvider({
    clientId: process.env.TWITTER_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_SECRET
  })
],
...
```

5. Once a provider has been setup, you can sign in at the following URL: `[origin]/api/auth/signin`. This is an unbranded auto-generated page with all the configured providers.

      checks: OAuthChecks
    },
    { tokens: TokenSet }

   */
  idToken?: boolean
  region?: string

}
```

Even if you are using a built-in provider, you can override any of these options to tweak the default configuration.

```js title=[...nextauth].js
import Auth0Provider from "next-auth/providers/auth0"

Auth0Provider({
  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  issuer: process.env.ISSUER,
  scope: "openid your_custom_scope", // We do provide a default, but this will override it if defined
  profile(profile) {
    return {} // Return the profile in a shape that is different from the built-in one.
  },
})
```

## Using a custom provider

You can use an OAuth provider that isn't built-in by using a custom object.

As an example of what this looks like, this is the provider object returned for the Google provider:

```js
{
  id: "google",
  name: "Google",
  type: "oauth",
  wellKnown: "https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
  authorization: { params: { scope: "openid email profile" } },
  idToken: true,
  checks: ["pkce", "state"],
  profile(profile) {
    return {
      id: profile.sub,
      name: profile.name,
      email: profile.email,
      image: profile.picture,
    }
  },
}
```

As you can see, if your provider supports OpenID Connect and the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint contains support for the `grant_type`: `authorization_code`, you only need to pass the URL to that configuration file and define some basic fields like `name` and `type`.

Otherwise, you can pass a more full set of URLs for each OAuth2.0 flow step, for example:

```js
{
  id: "kakao",
  name: "Kakao",
  type: "oauth",
  authorization: "https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/authorize",
  token: "https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/token",
  userinfo: "https://kapi.kakao.com/v2/user/me",
  profile(profile) {
    return {
      id: profile.id,
      name: profile.kakao_account?.profile.nickname,
      email: profile.kakao_account?.email,
      image: profile.kakao_account?.profile.profile_image_url,
    }
  },
}
```

Replace all the options in this JSON object with the ones from your custom provider - be sure to give it a unique ID and specify the required URLs, and finally add it to the providers array when initializing the library:

```js title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import TwitterProvider from "next-auth/providers/twitter"
...
providers: [
  TwitterProvider({
    clientId: process.env.TWITTER_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_SECRET,
  }),
  {
    id: 'customProvider',
    name: 'CustomProvider',
    type: 'oauth',
    scope: ''  // Make sure to request the users email address
    ...
  }
]
...
```

## Built-in providers

NextAuth.js comes with a set of built-in providers. You can find them [here](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/src/providers). Each built-in provider has its own documentation page:

<div className="provider-name-list">
{Object.entries(require("../../../providers.json"))
  .filter(([key]) => !["email", "credentials"].includes(key))
  .sort(([, a], [, b]) => a.localeCompare(b))
  .map(([key, name]) => (
    <span key={key}>
      <a href={`/providers/${key}`}>{name}</a>
      <span className="provider-name-list__comma">,</span>
    </span>
  )
)}
</div>

### Override default options

For built-in providers, in most cases you will only need to specify the `clientId` and `clientSecret`. If you need to override any of the defaults, add your own [options](#options).

For example, the `profile` callback will return `id`, `name`, `email` and `picture` by default, but you might need more information from the provider. After setting the correct scopes, you can then do something like this:

```js title=/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
export default function NextAuth({
  ...,
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      authorization: { params: {scope: "your custom scopes"} },
      profile(profile) {
        return {
          // Return all the profile information you need
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

### Adding a new provider

If you think your custom provider might be useful to others, we encourage you to open a PR and add it to the built-in list so others can discover it much more easily!

You only need to add two changes:

1. Add your config: [`src/providers/{provider}.ts`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/src/providers)<br />
   • make sure you use a named default export, like this: `export default function YourProvider`
2. Add provider documentation: [`/docs/providers/{provider}.md`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/docs/tree/main/docs/providers)

That's it! 🎉 Others will be able to discover and use this provider much more easily now!
