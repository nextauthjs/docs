Events are asynchronous functions that do not return a response, they are useful for audit logs / reporting or handling any other side-effects.

You can specify a handler for any of these events below, for debugging or for an audit log.

:::note
The execution of your authentication API will be blocked by an `await` on your event handler. If your event handler starts any burdensome work it should not block its own promise on that work.
