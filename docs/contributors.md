## History

NextAuth.js was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins">Iain Collins</a> in 2016.

In 2020, NextAuth.js was rebuilt from the ground up to support Serverless, with support for MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens and built in support for over a dozen authentication providers.
