## Other Contributors

NextAuth.js as it exists today has been possible thanks to the work of many individual contributors.

Thank you to the [dozens of individual contributors](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/graphs/contributors) who have help shaped NextAuth.js.

## History

NextAuth.js was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins">Iain Collins</a> in 2016.

In 2020, NextAuth.js was rebuilt from the ground up to support Serverless, with support for MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens and built in support for over a dozen authentication providers.
